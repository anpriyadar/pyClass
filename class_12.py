# operators --> They are use to perform operations on variables and values.

# number1= 11
# number2=20
# number3=3
#
# addition = number1 + number2
#
# print(number1/number3)

# Kind of Operators in Python
# 1. Arithmetic Operator - These Opeartors will be used to do mathematical operations
#       + => Addition
#       - => Substraction
#       * => Multiplication
#       / => Division
#       % => Modulus
#       ** => Exponentiation
#       // Floor division

# 2. Assignment Opertor
# x=10
# x+=3
# x-=2
# print(x)

# 3. Comparison Operator
number1 =20
number2=30

# print(number1==number2)
# print(number1!=number2)
# print(number1>number2)
# print(number1<number2)
#
# print(number1>=number2)
# print(number1<=number2)


# 4. Logical Operator - and, or , not

number1=30

#number1 should be smaller than 20
#OR
#number1 should also be smaller than 50

# isgreator = not(number1<20 and number2<50)
# print(isgreator)


# 5. Identity Opearator - is , is not

x = ("ram", "shayam")
y = ("ram", "shayam")

z=x
print(x is y)
# 6. BitWise Operator


dog= ["abc",4]
